# Car_Price_Predictor
## Introduction :
The project successfully demonstrates the application of Linear and Lasso Regression models for predicting car prices, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing and model evaluation. The results indicate that with proper data handling and model tuning, it's possible to achieve accurate predictions, which can be useful for car dealerships and buyers in making informed pricing decisions. However, further model refinement and the exploration of more advanced algorithms could potentially improve prediction accuracy.


## Overview
In this project, the objective is to predict car prices based on features like car age, mileage, engine size, and other characteristics using machine learning techniques. We start by processing a dataset that contains both the features and the actual prices of cars, which is then split into a training set (90%) for the model to learn from and a test set (10%) to evaluate its predictive performance. The main goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict the price of a car given its features.

A regression model is used for this task, as the target variable (car price) is continuous. The model is trained on the training dataset by learning the underlying patterns between the car features and their corresponding prices. During the training phase, the model fine-tunes its parameters to minimize the prediction errors. After training, the model is tested on the remaining test data to see how well it generalizes to new, unseen data.

To visually evaluate the model's performance, a scatter plot is generated, comparing the actual car prices with the predicted prices. The closer the points are to the diagonal line (where predicted prices equal actual prices), the better the model's predictions are. A regression line is also included to provide a clear representation of the overall trend of the predictions relative to the actual prices.

This project demonstrates the process of applying machine learning to predict car prices, from training and testing a regression model to visualizing its effectiveness. The combination of data analysis, model training, and visualization helps in assessing the model's accuracy and making further improvements if needed.


## Conclusion :
As we know that, Linear Regression is best when you have a linear relationship, relatively few predictors, and no severe multicollinearity. Lasso Regression is preferred when you have many predictors, want to manage multicollinearity, and need feature selection or a simpler model. Here we can see that, Lasso regression model gives us better result than the linear regression model.
